In this assignment, you will enhance the application in assignment #1 with a feature so users can create new students through the application. The implementation should include at least the following functionalities. 

1.	Add a ‘Add’ menu item on the Summary screen. 

2.	As soon as the menu item is clicked by the user, the application will navigate to a blank Detail screen that looks like as follows. 

3.	In addition to enter the First Name, Last Name and CWID, all vehicle data need to be entered. 

4.	To create a new course, just click the ‘Add Course’ button and one new row will be appended at the end of the Course summary list. Then, the user can enter the data for the new course. 

5.	After all course data is entered, user then clicks the ‘Done’ menu item to add the Student object to the data model.

Please make sure that the screen is refreshed with the new Student object after user navigates back to the Summary screen. 


Although the approaches used in my lecture can be used in the implementation, you could come up with your own approaches.
